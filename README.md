# Summary

Well, hello there! I'm Simon, and I like solving complex problems, alongside intelligent people. I'm comfortable with Mathematica and Python from my mathematical background, and with SQL, Ruby/Rails, and HTML/CSS from a couple projects of mine. I'm a big fan of Active Record, in particular.

If you want to chat about interesting problems, shoot me an email at <slepkin@gmail.com>.
